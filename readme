I wanted to find a price alert for stocks and currencies
so I can make bizillions of dollars with the least of amount of time as possible
but I couldn't find one without a paywall or timelimit.

some price alerts only had about 2 month time limit.

as we have seen in highs in tesla in 2020 at 950 per share. 
before that, the previous highs were at 381 dollars per share on june 12, 2017 where
price per share just floated around.

eventually the tesla stock dropped to 180 on june 9, 2019 before skyrocketing to 900 dollars.
the most best, opportunity to purhase tesla stock did not appear until about two years later.
which lead to write this script.

couple of things I wish to do with this program.

1. inital build of stock price alert - complete
2. build a forex price alert
3. failed price alert
4. get it up and running on heroku server
5. put each securities into classes
6. finish

1. the stock price alert is in python with scheduled to run at 2:30, 30 minutes after my
the market closes. I have it send a email notification when it hits the price i want.

2. I will build a forex price alert, slightly more difficult because each
currency pair uses a slightly different notation.

3. sometimes, price will not go drop where I want to buy or go up where I want to sell 
then continue on its merry own way. I am going to set the program to send an email saying
that I need to reset the parameters to the program.

4. upload my code onto heroku servers, so I never have to keep my laptop running. also, set up 
sms messaging to get text for higher ratio trades.

5. make a base class in python, so if I ever wish to expand to different securities
such as bonds, precious metal and commodities. I will have a road map.

6. eventaully I have the program running where I never have to look at until I get an email
or text message.
