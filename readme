I wanted to find a price alert for stocks and currencies
so I can make bizillions of dollars with the least of amount of time as possible
but I couldn't find one without a paywall or timelimit.

I decided to write my own in python with scheduled to run at 2:30, 30 minutes after my
the market closes.

eventually, I am going to set it up on heroku servers so I never have to look at it.
